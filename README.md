=======================

This example app illustrates the use of the [Worldline Connect Swift SDK](https://github.com/Worldline-Global-Collect/connect-sdk-client-swift) and the services provided by Worldline Global Collect on the Worldline Global Collect platform.

See the [Worldline Connect Developer Hub](https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/sdk/mobile/swift/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

Prerequisites
------------

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.
 To install the dependencies this example app requires, you will need to install the CocoaPods Ruby gem.

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Installation
------------

To obtain the example app for the Worldline Connect Swift SDK, first clone the code from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Worldline-Global-Collect/connect-sdk-client-swift-example.git
```

Then run the following command to install the dependencies with CocoaPods:

```
$ pod install
```

Afterwards, you can open and run the Xcode workspace that is now created to run the example app.
